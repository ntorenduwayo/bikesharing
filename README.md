# bikesharing
## Overview of the statistical analysis:
Last summer, Me and my friend Kate we visited New York City.  During the city tour, we mostly biked everywhere using CitiBike (i.e., a privately owned public bicycle sharing system in New York City). Hence, we wondered if the same idea could work in Des Moines, Iowa our hometown. However, we realized that the mechanics that make this business work in New York might be different in Des Moines. </br>
Thus, before we embarked on the project, a prior understanding of how this business works in New York City was imperative.  As a result, decided to apply the power of Tableau to analyze and visualize the August 2018, CitiBike data to unveil any hidden features that could be a key to our project success in Des Moines.</br>

## Results:
We used a combination of different graphs to unveil trends and patterns within the data. </br>
#### Image 1: Trips count

#### Image 3: Bikeshare User Gender Breakdown

In the above 3 images, we see that there were 2,344,244 trips in New York during the month of August 2018. We further notice that more than 3/4 of the CitiBike user were subscribers. The bikeshare riders are predominantly male (65.3%), followed female (25.1%), and unknown (9.6%).

#### Image 4: Starting Bikeshare Locations

#### Image 5: Ending Bikeshare Locations

As we can see in the above maps, the starting location where the bicycle trips started and the location where the trips ended are recorded. Thus, each circle represents a particular location, and its size and color darkness are relative to the number of trips that started or ended at that location. A closer look at the maps revealed that most of the trips took place mostly in Manhattan, while a lesser bike sharing usage was mostly in suburban areas.

#### Image 6: Average Trip Duration by Birth Year

The graph above shows a bike sharing across all age classes. But also, it appears that younger people (Between 22 years old and 50 years old) rode longest, meaning they enjoyed the most bike sharing in the city.

#### Image 7: Checkout Times

#### Image 8: Checkout Times by Gender

The graphs above show that most of the trips’ duration are under an hour, and the trips’duration peak is 5 minutes. Furthermore, the Checkout Times By Gender graph emphasized that most bikeshare users were males followed by females.

#### Image 9: Trips by Weekday per Hour

The heat map above displays the weekly usage patterns, and it clearly shows a heavy bikeshare during the commute period on weekdays. However, during the weekend the pattern changes, and most bikeshare rides take place in the middle of the day.

#### Image 10: Trips by Weekday and Gender

In the above heat map, once again the male bikeshare use dominance is revealed, and most users are subscribers.

## Summary:
In brief, BikeCiti bikeshare services are very popular in New York City especially in the heart of the city compared to its suburbs. The BikeCiti base market is comprised mostly by male subscribers. An most bikeshare usage are during the commute times.</br>
Thus, this kind of service would be a good fit for Des Moines city especially its downtown. But we would advise to look more closely at the bikeshare’s female users to find if there is a way to increase their participation in the bikeshare services.
